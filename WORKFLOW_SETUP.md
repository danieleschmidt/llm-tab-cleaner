# üöÄ GitHub Workflows Setup Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission restrictions, the CI/CD workflows cannot be automatically created in `.github/workflows/`. Please follow these steps to activate the comprehensive workflow system:

## üìã Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Copy Template Workflows

```bash
# Copy the CI workflow
cp docs/workflows/ci.yml.template .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Copy the security workflow  
cp docs/workflows/security.yml.template .github/workflows/security.yml

# Copy the release workflow
cp docs/workflows/release.yml.template .github/workflows/release.yml
```

### 2. Configure Repository Secrets

Add these secrets in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Secrets and Variables ‚Üí Actions:

```
PYPI_API_TOKEN              # PyPI publishing
TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN         # Test PyPI publishing  
CODECOV_TOKEN               # Coverage reporting
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_TEST      # Integration testing
OPENAI_API_KEY_TEST         # Integration testing
```

### 3. Set Up Repository Environments

Create these environments in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Environments:
- **`pypi`**: Production publishing environment with admin approval
- **`test-pypi`**: Staging environment for pre-release testing

### 4. Enable Branch Protection

In GitHub Settings ‚Üí Branches, add protection for `main`:
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Require review from CODEOWNERS
- Select these required status checks:
  - `lint-and-format`
  - `type-check`
  - `test (3.11)`
  - `security-scan`
  - `build`

## üéØ Expected Results

Once activated, you'll have:
- **Multi-version testing** across Python 3.9-3.12
- **Comprehensive security scanning** with Bandit, Safety, and Trivy
- **Automated package building** and testing
- **Test PyPI publishing** on develop branch pushes
- **PyPI publishing** on tagged releases
- **Coverage reporting** to Codecov
- **Security results** in GitHub Security tab

## üîß Workflow Features

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- Parallel execution for faster feedback
- Multi-version Python testing
- Code quality checks (ruff, black, mypy)
- Security scanning (bandit, safety)
- Package building and installation testing
- Coverage reporting
- Test result artifacts

### Security Workflow (`security.yml`) 
- Weekly scheduled security scans
- Dependency vulnerability detection
- Code security analysis with SARIF
- Secret detection with TruffleHog
- Container security scanning
- SBOM generation
- Security summary reporting

### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- Semantic version validation
- Package signing with Sigstore
- Trusted publishing to PyPI
- Release notes generation
- Documentation deployment
- Rollback procedures

## üö® Critical Priority

**This setup is Priority #0** - it enables all other development work by providing:
- Automated quality gates
- Security vulnerability detection  
- Reliable release processes
- Development velocity improvements

**Estimated Setup Time**: 15 minutes  
**Value Impact**: Unblocks entire development pipeline
