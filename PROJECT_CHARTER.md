# LLM Tab Cleaner Project Charter

## Project Overview

### Project Name
**LLM Tab Cleaner**: Production-Grade LLM-Powered Data Cleaning Framework

### Project Vision
Transform data cleaning from manual drudgery to intelligent automation, making high-quality data accessible to every organization through production-ready ETL pipelines powered by Large Language Models.

### Project Mission
Operationalize cutting-edge LLM-assisted data cleaning research into enterprise-grade tools that provide >70% reduction in data quality issues with full audit trails, confidence scoring, and multi-engine support.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Challenges

#### 1. Manual Data Cleaning is Unsustainable
- **Scale Problem**: Organizations process terabytes of messy data daily
- **Cost Problem**: Data scientists spend 80% of time on data cleaning
- **Quality Problem**: Manual cleaning is error-prone and inconsistent
